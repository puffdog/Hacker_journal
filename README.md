# Gift Mabasa | Hacker Journal 🚀

Welcome to my ethical hacking journey!  
This repository documents my step-by-step progress through **wargames, pentesting, and bug bounty hunting**.  

I am starting with **OverTheWire Bandit** to master Linux fundamentals and then moving on to web hacking, binary exploitation, and real-world bug bounty challenges.
